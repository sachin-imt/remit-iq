You have found the cheapest provider, locked in a great exchange rate, and hit "send." But have you considered the tax and regulatory implications on both sides of the transfer?

Whether you are supporting family, buying property, or repatriating savings, there are rules in both Australia and India that can affect your transfer. Ignoring them can lead to delays, frozen funds, or unnecessary tax bills.

Here is what you need to know — in plain English.

## Australian Side: ATO Reporting Rules

### The $10,000 Threshold

Under Australian law, any international funds transfer instruction (IFTI) of **$10,000 AUD or more** is automatically reported by your bank or transfer provider to **AUSTRAC** (the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre). This is not a tax — it is an anti-money laundering measure.

You do not need to do anything. The reporting happens automatically. However, you should be aware that:

- Deliberately splitting a $15,000 transfer into two $7,500 transfers to avoid this threshold is called **structuring** and is a criminal offence
- The reporting does not trigger an ATO audit by itself, but the data is available to the ATO if they choose to review your file

### Capital Gains Considerations

If you are sending money that came from selling Australian assets (shares, property, crypto), you may owe Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on the profit. The transfer itself is not taxed, but the event that generated the funds might be.

Similarly, if you hold AUD in a foreign currency account and the exchange rate moves in your favour before you convert, the ATO considers that a **forex gain** and it may be taxable.

### Gifts Are Not Taxed in Australia

Australia has no gift tax. You can send any amount to family in India without any Australian tax consequence, as long as the funds themselves were already taxed (e.g., from your after-tax salary or savings).

## Indian Side: FEMA and TCS Rules

### FEMA Limits for Receiving

The Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) governs all foreign currency transactions in India. For most personal remittances (family maintenance, gifts, education), there is **no upper limit** on how much an Indian resident can receive from abroad.

However, the recipient's bank will ask for documentation if the amount is large:

- **Purpose of remittance** (gift, family maintenance, property purchase, loan repayment)
- **Relationship between sender and receiver**
- **KYC documentation** from the recipient

### Tax Collected at Source (TCS)

TCS applies when an Indian resident sends money *out* of India under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). It does not directly apply to money coming *into* India from Australia. However, if your recipient in India later tries to send money abroad, they will encounter TCS:

- **5% TCS** on remittances for education (above ₹7 lakh per financial year)
- **20% TCS** on remittances for all other purposes (above ₹7 lakh per financial year)
- TCS is not an additional tax — it is an advance tax that can be claimed back when filing an income tax return

### Are Gifts Taxable in India?

This is where it gets nuanced:

- **Gifts from close relatives** (parents, siblings, spouse, in-laws as defined under the Income Tax Act) are **completely tax-free** in India, regardless of amount
- **Gifts from non-relatives** exceeding **₹50,000** in a financial year are taxable as "Income from Other Sources" for the recipient

If you are sending money to a friend or distant relative in India, they may owe income tax on the received amount. Make sure you understand the relationship definitions under Indian tax law.

## Property Purchases: Special Rules

Buying property in India from Australia triggers additional compliance:

- **RBI approval** is not required if you are an NRI (Non-Resident Indian) or PIO (Person of Indian Origin) buying residential or commercial property
- **Agricultural land, plantation property, and farmhouses** cannot be purchased by NRIs without special RBI permission
- **Repatriation** of sale proceeds is limited to two residential properties, and subject to conditions under FEMA
- All payments must be made through **NRE or NRO accounts** in India — you cannot pay a seller directly from an Australian account

## Practical Tips to Stay Compliant

1. **Keep records of every transfer** — date, amount, provider, exchange rate, and purpose. Both the ATO and Indian tax authorities may request documentation
2. **Use the same name** on your Australian bank account and Indian receiving account to avoid delays from compliance checks
3. **Declare large gifts in advance** — if sending a large amount (over ₹10 lakh) as a gift to a relative in India, have the recipient inform their bank beforehand to prevent a temporary hold
4. **Consult a cross-border tax advisor** if you are dealing with property, investments, or amounts over $50,000 AUD. The rules interact in complex ways that generic advice cannot cover

## The Transfer Itself Should Be the Easy Part

Tax and compliance rules are complicated enough. The actual transfer — finding the best rate, comparing fees, and timing the market — should not add to the headache.
