If you have ever sent money from Australia to India through your bank and thought "great, no fees!"—you almost certainly overpaid. The transfer fee you see on the receipt is only a fraction of the real cost.

Here is a breakdown of every hidden charge between your Australian bank account and the recipient's Indian account, and how to avoid each one.

## The Three Layers of Cost

Every international money transfer has up to three separate costs. Most people only see the first one.

### Layer 1: The Transfer Fee (The Decoy)

This is the number that banks and services advertise loudly. "Send money to India for just $0!" or "Flat fee of $5.99!"

This fee is almost irrelevant. It is designed to distract you from the real cost hiding in Layer 2.

### Layer 2: The Exchange Rate Margin (The Silent Killer)

This is where the real money is made. Every bank and most transfer services take the true mid-market exchange rate and add a **margin** (also called a markup or spread).

Here is a practical example:

- **Today's real mid-market rate:** 1 AUD = ₹55.00
- **Your bank's offered rate:** 1 AUD = ₹53.50
- **The hidden margin:** ₹1.50 per dollar (approximately **2.7%**)

On a $5,000 AUD transfer, that 2.7% margin costs you **₹7,500** — roughly **$136 AUD** — silently deducted before the money even leaves Australia. And the bank still calls it a "zero fee" transfer.

### Layer 3: The Receiving Bank Fee

Some Indian banks charge an incoming international wire fee (often called a "beneficiary charge"). This is typically ₹150 to ₹500, deducted from the amount received. HDFC Bank, SBI, and ICICI all have different policies, and the fee can change depending on whether the transfer arrives via SWIFT or through a local payment network.

## How Major Providers Compare on Hidden Costs

Not all services operate the same way. Here is a transparency scorecard:

**Wise** charges an upfront percentage fee (around 0.45%) but gives you the exact mid-market rate with zero margin. What you see is what you get.

**Remitly** often advertises zero fees but embeds a noticeable margin in the exchange rate, typically between 0.5% and 1.5% depending on the transfer amount and payment method.

**Banks (CBA, NAB, ANZ, Westpac)** are consistently the most expensive option. They combine a visible wire fee ($20 to $30) with an exchange rate margin that often exceeds 3%. On a $10,000 transfer, you could lose over $300 compared to a digital provider.

**OFX and TorFX** target larger transfers ($2,000+) with competitive margins (often 0.3% to 0.7%) and no fixed fees, but their rates are not published publicly — you must get a quote.

## How to Calculate the True Cost Yourself

Before you send money, follow this simple formula:

1. Google "AUD to INR mid-market rate" to get today's true rate
2. Multiply your send amount by that rate to get the *maximum possible* Rupees
3. Compare that number to the amount the provider says will arrive
4. The difference is your **total cost** — fees and margin combined

If the math feels tedious, that is exactly the problem we built RemitIQ to solve. Our homepage calculator does this comparison across six providers simultaneously, in real time.

## The One Rule That Saves You Money Every Time

**Never look at the fee. Always look at the final amount received.**

A provider charging $4.99 with a tight exchange rate will almost always beat a provider charging $0 with a wide margin. The only number that matters is how many Rupees land in the recipient's account.
