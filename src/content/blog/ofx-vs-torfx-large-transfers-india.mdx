If you are transferring a large sum—$5,000, $10,000, or even $50,000 AUD—to India, you have likely come across **OFX** and **TorFX**. Both are well-established foreign exchange brokers that specifically target high-value transfers.

But they operate very differently from consumer apps like Wise or Remitly, and choosing between them requires understanding a few key distinctions.

## The Business Model: Brokers, Not Apps

Unlike Wise and Remitly, which publish their rates online for anyone to see, OFX and TorFX function more like traditional currency brokers. You typically need to register, verify your identity, and request a personalised quote before you see any pricing.

This sounds inconvenient, but it comes with a significant advantage: **negotiable rates**. The more you send, and the more frequently you transfer, the better your rate gets.

## OFX: The Data-Driven Platform

OFX (formerly OzForex) is an Australian-born company listed on the ASX. They have processed over $150 billion in transfers since their founding.

**Strengths:**
- **No transfer fees** on any amount, ever. Their entire revenue comes from the exchange rate margin
- **24/7 phone support** with dedicated dealers for transfers over $10,000
- **Forward contracts** let you lock in today's rate for a transfer up to 12 months in the future — ideal if you are saving for a property purchase in India
- **Limit orders** allow you to set a target rate and OFX will execute the transfer automatically when the market hits your price

**Considerations:**
- The exchange rate margin is not published; you must log in to see your rate
- For smaller amounts (under $2,000), the margin can be less competitive than Wise

## TorFX: The Personal Touch

TorFX is a UK-based broker with a strong presence in Australia. They won the "Best Customer Service" award from Canstar multiple years in a row.

**Strengths:**
- **Dedicated account manager** assigned to every customer, regardless of transfer size
- **Rate matching** — if you find a better rate with a competitor, TorFX will often match or beat it
- **No fees** on transfers over $2,000 AUD
- **Regular payment plans** designed for expats who send fixed monthly amounts to India

**Considerations:**
- Transfers can take 1 to 3 business days (slower than Instarem or Wise)
- Like OFX, rates are quote-based and not publicly visible

## Head-to-Head: The Key Differences

**For a one-time large transfer** (buying property, paying tuition, settling a loan), OFX's forward contracts and limit orders give you more control over timing. You can lock in a rate today and execute the transfer when you are ready.

**For recurring monthly transfers** (supporting family, paying a mortgage), TorFX's personal account manager and regular payment plans simplify the process. Having a human who knows your situation and proactively calls you when rates improve is genuinely valuable.

**For transparency**, neither wins. Both operate on a quote-based model, which means you cannot easily comparison-shop without registering. This is where a live comparison tool becomes essential.

## The Real Question: Are They Actually Cheaper Than Wise?

For transfers under $5,000, Wise almost always wins because their mid-market rate with a transparent 0.45% fee is hard to beat.

For transfers above $10,000, OFX and TorFX can sometimes beat Wise because their margins shrink as the amount grows, and they have no percentage-based fee that scales with the transfer size.

The crossover point — where a broker becomes cheaper than a transparent-fee platform — shifts every day based on market conditions.

## Stop Guessing. Let the Data Decide.

Instead of registering on three separate platforms and comparing quotes manually, use RemitIQ to see live pricing from Wise, Remitly, OFX, TorFX, Instarem, and Western Union — all on one screen, updated in real time.
