If you are sending money from Australia to India, you have likely narrowed your choices down to **Wise** (formerly TransferWise) and **Remitly**. They are the two titans of the digital remittance space.

But which one is *actually* cheaper right now? 

Because exchange rates change every second, reading an article from six months ago won't help you. That is why we built the **RemitIQ Live Engine**. The comparison box below is pulling the exact, real-time data for a $2,000 AUD transfer to India *right now as you read this page*.

## How Make Money (The Hidden Margin)

When you send money overseas, companies make a profit in two ways:
1. **The Upfront Fee:** A visible, flat fee (e.g., $1.99 or $4.99).
2. **The Exchange Rate Margin:** A hidden markup on the true interbank exchange rate.

### Wise's Approach
Wise is famous for absolute transparency. They give you the **exact mid-market rate** (meaning a 0% margin). To make money, they charge a higher upfront percentage fee (usually around 0.45%). What you see is exactly what you get.

### Remitly's Approach
Remitly often advertises "$0 fees" for your first transfer, or very low fixed fees. However, they make their money on the **margin**. They might offer you an exchange rate of ₹63.50 when the real interbank rate is ₹64.00. 

## Which One Should You Choose?

*   **Choose Wise if:** You are sending larger amounts (over $3,000 AUD). Because Wise has no hidden margin, their math scales much better for large transfers. Even with their percentage fee, you almost always end up with more Rupees in the receiving account.
*   **Choose Remitly if:** You are sending smaller amounts (under $500 AUD) or you are a *brand new user*. Remitly usually offers a temporary "Promotional Rate" for your very first transfer that is heavily subsidized and often unbeatable. 

### Final Verdict

Always check the math before you hit send. Luckily, you don't have to pull out a calculator anymore. Just look at the real-time comparison box at the top of this article, or [head to our homepage](/ "Compare all providers") to see Wise and Remitly ranked against the rest of the market!
